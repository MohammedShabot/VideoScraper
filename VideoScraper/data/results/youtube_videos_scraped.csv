guilt pensioner desert,youtube,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaDopEbIY4E,Do not file for divorce unless you are sure about this,56,347465,"As a family law practitioner, I often consult a lot of husbands and wives who face matrimonial issues. A frequent scenario I encounter is when a spouse feels slightly neglected and subconsciously believes that sending a legal notice or filing for divorce will make their partner realize their importance, apologize, and restore the love and attention they desire.

 

I explain to my clients that when drafting a legal notice or divorce case, a lawyer will typically advise including numerous exaggerated allegations beyond the actual events. This approach is taken to ensure that if a full-fledged divorce is pursued, the case is as legally robust as possible.

 

While I can assure you that such a draft would outline all legally valid grounds for divorce however, the original intent behind sending a legal notice or filing a divorce petition gets defeated. The reality is that after reading these exaggerated allegations, any remaining chance for reconciliation is likely to be lost. Your spouse will probably consult another lawyer to respond to such a legal notice or divorce petition who will then escalate the situation by suggesting even more severe counter-allegations.

 

Therefore, if you are not entirely certain about 100% separation, it is advisable not to send a legal notice or file any case against your spouse.

Better Call Saul is the prequel to the award-winning series Breaking Bad, set six years before Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) became Walter White's lawyer. When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is ""fixer"" Mike Erhmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts ""criminal"" in ""criminal lawyer.""

»Subscribe to CBC Arts to watch more videos: http://bit.ly/CBCArtsSubscribe

There's a doll in The Museum of Fear and Wonder that, depending on your leaning, could be read as charming or chill-inducing. You can make a decision on your own about whether the doll, in itself, is frightful, but it's a good example of how the stories we build around objects have everything to do with how we see them.

These sorts of complicated mysterious objects make up the collection of The Museum, founded by brothers Brendan Griebel and Jude Griebel. There's already a tradition of museums that house curiosities, but the focus of this one is particularly on objects that have a psychological or narrative association. So, inside the re-purposed army barracks near Bergen, Alberta, you can find things like the aforementioned doll, a chess set made by a death row prisoner in the period before his execution, dollhouses, anatomical models, and plenty of other objects that have had emotional relationships with their owners or makers.

In the above video, the brothers take you inside  if you dare.

More about National Gallery Singapore (from Visit Singapore):

Fittingly located in the heart of the Civic District, the Gallery is housed in the City Hall and the former Supreme Courttwo iconic buildings that have played a monumental role in Singapore's history. Utmost care was taken to ensure that preservation guidelines for these two national monuments were being upheld even as they were being remodelled into a state-of-the-art museum for the public.

Dedicated to curating a collection that will provide insights into the unique art, heritage and history in the region, the Gallery is a must-visit destination in Singapore. At 64,000 square metres, it is the largest visual arts venue in Singapore and one of the largest in the region.",JustSomeGuyWalking,20220217

Dozens of people who moved to retire in France told me the cons and their biggest regrets.

 EXCERPT 
Have you ever thought about moving to France
but worried about hidden challenges?
Those certain things nobody tells you,
either because they are afraid
or ashamed,
or because it is not politically correct?
